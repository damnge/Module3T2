# Tooling Bootstrap

In this task from Module 3 (Vefskolinn Course). I've used Bootstrap as my UI framework to create a simple responsive Blog and Sign Up page.

I've installed Bootstrap and used 4 different components that I've later customized for my own needs and look:

* Navbar
* Card Component
* Sign Up Form
* Footer

## Thoughts on UI Framework

Using Bootstrap as UI Framework can be very useful especially if you need to create a page very fast.
Though customizing it through CSS can take quite a bit of time and it's not pleasant, in this situation Tailwind is winning with Bootstrap because it offers more personal, easier, and deeper customization.

However, personally, I'm not the biggest fan of UI frameworks as going through the docs and customizing and learning it takes some time and it's not such a valuable skill on the market. If I needed to build a website fast I would rather use Webflow, Elementor etc. Which in my opinion are more powerful website builders/ tools than Tailwind or Bootstrap.
